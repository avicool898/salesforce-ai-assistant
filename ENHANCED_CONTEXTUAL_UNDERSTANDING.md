# Enhanced Contextual Understanding Implementation

## 🧠 Advanced Page Analysis System

Your Salesforce extension now implements the four key contextual understanding techniques you described:

### 1. 📊 Page Context Access
**Comprehensive page data extraction including:**
- **Navigation Structure**: Breadcrumbs, tabs, menus, contextual actions
- **Layout Patterns**: Page type identification, sections, panels, modals
- **Interactive Elements**: Forms, buttons, links, input patterns
- **Data Structures**: Tables, lists, record layouts
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Headers, emphasis patterns, spacing
- **Accessibility Patterns**: Landmarks, labels, focus management

### 2. 🔍 Semantic Parsing
**Understanding component relationships and functions:**
- **Page Intent Detection**: Create, edit, browse, configure, interact, analyze
- **User Journey Analysis**: Stage identification, progress tracking, next steps
- **Workflow Stage Recognition**: Flow, approval, data-entry stages
- **Contextual Relationships**: Parent-child, master-detail, lookup relationships
- **Functional Grouping**: Data entry, navigation, actions, information groups

### 3. 📚 Knowledge Matching
**Salesforce domain expertise integration:**
- **Object Type Recognition**: Standard and custom objects with patterns
- **Setup Area Identification**: User management, object manager, process automation
- **Workflow Type Classification**: Data entry, configuration, analysis workflows
- **Best Practices Database**: Object-specific and area-specific guidance
- **Common Issues Detection**: Validation errors, incomplete fields, permission issues
- **Next Steps Suggestions**: Context-aware action recommendations

### 4. 🎯 Conversational Framing
**Natural dialogue preparation:**
- **User Level Assessment**: Beginner, intermediate, advanced based on page complexity
- **Contextual Tone Determination**: Supportive, cautious, encouraging, informative
- **Response Style Adaptation**: Step-by-step, guided, focused, overview styles
- **Priority Focus Areas**: Error resolution, field completion, modal interaction
- **Suggested Questions**: Context-specific question recommendations

## 🚀 Implementation Features

### Advanced Context Detection
```javascript
// Enhanced page analysis with four intelligence layers
performAdvancedPageAnalysis() {
  // 1. Page Context Access
  this.pageStructure = this.extractPageStructure();
  
  // 2. Semantic Parsing
  this.semanticComponents = this.performSemanticParsing();
  
  // 3. Knowledge Matching
  const knowledgeContext = this.knowledgeBase.matchPageContext();
  
  // 4. Conversational Framing
  this.conversationalContext = this.buildConversationalFraming();
}
```

### Intelligent Form Analysis
- **Section-based field grouping** with completion tracking
- **Validation error detection** and prioritization
- **Required field identification** and guidance
- **Progress calculation** and journey stage assessment

### Dynamic Quick Actions
- **Context-aware suggestions** based on page intent
- **User level adaptation** (beginner vs advanced guidance)
- **Priority focus integration** (errors, completion, troubleshooting)
- **Real-time updates** as page context changes

### Enhanced AI Prompts
- **Structured context delivery** with semantic understanding
- **Knowledge synthesis** with Salesforce best practices
- **Conversational adaptation** based on user level and tone
- **Progressive guidance** appropriate for workflow stage

## 🎨 User Experience Enhancements

### Smart Context Display
```
📍 Setup - New User Creation - User (standard)
🖥️ Lightning Experience
🎯 Intent: Create
📈 Journey: Starting (0%)
📚 Object: User (standard)
⚙️ Setup: User Management
👤 Level: Intermediate
